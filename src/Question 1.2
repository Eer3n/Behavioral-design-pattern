1. What is Mediator design pattern and purpose:
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator
object.
This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different classes,
and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling.

2. What is Memento design pattern and purpose:
